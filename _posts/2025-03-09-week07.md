This week we split into teams and chose an open source project to work on together called Preswald.
<!--more-->
Preswald is a tool that lets you display and visualise the results of python code online. It took us a while to find a good project to contribute to as a lot of projects we were considering were way too complicated for our skillset (like scipy), too mature for us to make any meaningful contributions (like python), only had one contributor (like librosa), and more. I was suprised by how long it took us to find a good project as there are so many open source projects out there.

I found preswald and liked it becuase it was made by a small startup full of talented people, and the project had only started in december, so is new enough for us to make meaningful contributions. However, because the project is so new, there aren't that many issues for us to claim, so we had to find our own. We ran into some issues upon running the example code they gave us, and made our first couple pull requests by updating the dependency lists.

It's been a few days since we made that initial commits and they still haven't commented or approved it yet, and we still cannot access their slack, so we are thinking about writing an email to send to one of the maintainers to introduce ourselves and ask how we can help.

Overall, I enjoy the premise for the project and my team members and I work well together.
