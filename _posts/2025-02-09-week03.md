title: Week 3

This week I worked together with a couple of my classmates to make a firefox browser extension project. We first got to know each other and shared our interests and hobbies. We made sure to inquire about everyone's skills that would be relevant for this project, so we could delegate tasks appropriately. For example, Jared and I had taken a web development class last semester and hence bore a greater share of the development, while Chardin, having more experience in design and creative work, was tasked with designing the logo for the application.

It took us some time to decide what we wanted the project to be, but after some deliberation, we decided to make a productivity app that was based on the pomodoro method of studying. There are many such web extensions already on the firefox web store but we wanted one with no frills and a reset button so we decided it would be a fun, small-scale product to make for this group project.

As said before, my contributions was helping with the development, but I also think I filled the 'product manager' role for this project, doing things such as leadership and task delegation, organising meetings, etc. Managerial roles are something that I have enjoyed doing in the past and hope to do in the future as a job, so I found this activity pretty fulfilling.
