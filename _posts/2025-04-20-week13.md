This week we worked on our upcoming presentation on preswald, and also talked about open source in business

Not too much to report on this week. On wednesday we discussed how open-source can be utilised in business, and one thing that stood out to me was the concept of 'open core' as we realised that is what the preswald business model seems to be. Most of the functionalities and widgets are free to use and indeed made by people like us, however features like server space and custom widgets/designs are paid and is how Structured Labs intends to make money from preswald.

My group and I also met up on thursday to work on our presentation for the next week. The professor thought that we were making good progress and wanted us to present earlier. I enjoyed stepping back and seeing how far we had come since the first week I had come into class without really understanding what open source even is to working on a large scale project (for me) and having written a few code contributions that were successfully merged. We reflected on the highs and lows we experienced over the past few weeks and after rehearsing I am confident that we have a good presentation that will provide value to the other members of our class.
