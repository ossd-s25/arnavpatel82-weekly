My small contributions so far have been low-code and fairly simple, I've mainly been exploring and getting used to how collaboration and open source works.

I've corrected grammar and spelling for a couple articles on wikipedia, and hope to make more in depth contributions in the future (such as writing actual content myself). I've also added a bit of functionality to one of the browser extensions projects that we did in class and enjoyed the process of opening a pull request through git and github. I found it to be a very streamline process and have an appreciation for the developers who designed this process.

I look forward to the group project and making more complex contributions during the remainder of this course.
