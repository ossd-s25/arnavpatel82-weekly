title: Week 4
---

This we week we learned a bit more about git. I have used this tool before many times but never really had a formal lesson on how to use it. I didn't realise how powerful it was because all I really had been doing was pushing to and cloning from my personal github so i could share it with other people. I had never really taken advantage of branches and viewing file history. I look forward to using this newfound knowledge to be a better developer in the future.

I really liked some of the projects done by the other groups. I thought many of the ideas were quite creative and fun, such as the 'I did that' project, which is important when it comes to markets like browser extensions that are already saturated with tons of different projects. I also enjoyed (and drew inspiration) how groups approached making their projects open source friendly. For example, with team 7, they improved the pull request process by introducing labels that contributers can select when submitting their request, which I think streamlines the whole process.

I think the biggest takeaway for me is that it is important to listen to your teammates and play to their strengths when delegating tasks, as everyone has unique ideas and strengths which can help the project excel.
